## Additional Information

### Extension Versions

There are two versions: **release** and **pre-release**. Because [VS Code only supports](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#prerelease-extensions) `major.minor.patch` and not the additional [semver](https://semver.org/) labels for pre-releases, to know if a version is a pre-release or final release, check its `minor` number:

* `major.EVEN_NUMBER.patch` for final releases.
* `major.ODD_NUMBER.patch` for pre-releases.
